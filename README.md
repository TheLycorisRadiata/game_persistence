# VRMMORPG project

This one is a mouthful. The idea came around 2015 and I've started development on 03/17/21. As for the dev process, I'm not creating a VRMMO right away. It starts off as a text-based solo game, and more precisely, right now I'm aiming to make a standard text adventure. I doubt I'll make any real content for the text adventure version, since the focus is on developing the gameplay, not releasing anything.

I wonder why anyone would want to work on the project at this time, but if you're thinking of contacting me about this: forget it. Persistence will need a team at some point, but this is way too soon.
